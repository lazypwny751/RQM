# Security Policy

Version: 1.0

Effective Date: 11/18/24

Maintained by: Ege KILIÃ‡

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this security policy is to outline the principles, responsibilities, and processes for handling security concerns related to this open-source project. It aims to ensure the safety and integrity of the codebase while fostering trust within the community.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all code, documentation, and tools maintained as part of the Rust QEMU Manager. It is relevant to contributors, maintainers, users, and any third-party stakeholders.
## 3. Security Principles

  **Transparency**: Ensure openness regarding security practices and responses.<br>
  **Responsiveness**: Address and respond to security issues promptly.<br>
  **Proactive Measures**: Regularly audit the code for potential vulnerabilities.<br>
  **Minimal Disclosure**: Limit early knowledge of security vulnerabilities to essential parties until resolved.<br>

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

  **Project** Maintainers: Oversee adherence to security policies, coordinate security patches, and manage disclosure processes.<br>
  **Contributors**: Follow secure coding practices and report any discovered vulnerabilities.<br>
  **Security Lead**: [If applicable] A designated person or team responsible for security management, reviews, and audits.<br>

## 5. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, please follow the steps below:

  **Email**: Report the issue to [egekilic@proton.me]. This email is monitored by the security team and maintainers.<br>
  **Subject**: Use a clear and descriptive subject line, e.g., "Potential Security Issue: [Brief Description]."<br>
  **Details**: Provide as much detail as possible, including:<br>
      Steps to reproduce the issue.<br>
      The impact on the system.<br>
      Any potential fixes or suggestions.<br>

Note: Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed and resolved.

## 6. Handling Vulnerabilities

Once a report is received:

  **Acknowledgment**: The security team will acknowledge receipt within [48 hours].<br>
  **Assessment**: The team will verify and assess the issue's severity.<br>
  **Resolution**: A patch will be developed, tested, and merged into the project. The timeframe for resolution depends on the severity (e.g., critical issues within [14 days], non-critical issues within [30 days]).<br>
  **Notification**: Once resolved, affected parties and contributors will be notified, and a security advisory will be published.<br>

## 7. Security Patches and Updates

  **Release Management**: Security updates will be part of regular releases. Critical updates may be released out-of-band if needed.<br>
  **Advisory Publication**: Post-resolution, a security advisory detailing the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix will be published on [project website/repository].<br>

## 8. Secure Development Practices
  
  **Code Reviews**: All significant code contributions must undergo peer review.<br>
  **Dependency Management**: Dependencies will be regularly audited using tools such as [dependency checker].<br>
  **Security Training**: Maintainers and key contributors will receive periodic training on secure coding practices.<br>

## 9. Incident Response Plan

In the case of an active security incident:

  **Incident Triage**: Identify, categorize, and prioritize the incident.<br>
  **Immediate Actions**: Implement containment measures to prevent further damage.<br>
  **Investigation**: Perform a detailed analysis of the incident.<br>
  **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed at key stages of the investigation.<br>
  **Post-Mortem**: Conduct a review and update policies as needed to prevent recurrence.<br>
